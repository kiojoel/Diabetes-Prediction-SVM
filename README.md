# Predicting Diabetes using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The primary goal  is to develop a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which is a widely used dataset for diabetes research. The dataset includes several medical predictor variables and one target variable:

Predictor variables: Number of pregnancies, Glucose level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin level, BMI (Body Mass Index), Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age
Target variable: Diabetes outcome (1 for positive, 0 for negative)
